# Hi! I'm Matthew
I'm a Computer Science and Business student at McGill University. I've done research in Program Graph Generation and Security Analysis. I'm also interested in Markets and working with Financial Data. Here are some samples of my work:
<br>

* [**Cryptocurrency Market Analytics**](https://github.com/matthew-chang04/crypto-market-dashboard) - Supports real-time connection to Cryptocurrency exchanges, tracking simple market data and Options data to obtain additional insights like Implied Volatility, and the Greeks.
* [**Graph Research Tools**](https://github.com/matthew-chang04/Graph-Extraction-Tools) - Built scripts and tools to edit and analyze Code Property Graphs to optimise their interpretation by Security Analysis Models. Work was done in Scala, Python, and C++.
* [**Black Scholes Option Pricer**](https://github.com/matthew-chang04/Option-Pricing-Web-App) - Fullstack web application that manages a database storing Black-Scholes inputs and outputs, and displays data on a heatmap with shock-metric for Spot price AND Volatility.
