<h1>Hi! I'm Matthew</h1>

<p>I'm a Computer Science student at McGill University. I'm pursuing a minor in Business as well. I'm interested in data analytics, software design and cloud services. I'm currently working on some projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock Data Visualisation Tool - Tool that creates a dashboard for stock data by a given ticker. Built using Django and Python libraries for data analytics.</li>
<li>PDF Merging/Editing Tool - Allows users to easily edit PDF documents page by page efficiently. Developed to improve the tedious process of filing electronic legal documents at Golden Equity Properties (My current job) </li><br>
<p>*** Note that I'm taking the holidays to work on adding new features to my projects, so they're not available right now, but I'm making them public soon! <br><br>(In particular, working on using AWS to move my stock data visualisation website into production. This involves moving from the SQLite3 database I used for testing to a PostgreSQL database. I'm also trying to develop some predictive features using ML algorithms to improve the site.)</p>
