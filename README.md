<h1>Hi! I'm Matthew</h1>

<p>I'm a Computer Science and Business student at McGill University. I'm interested in Compilers and program optimisation/analysis. I also like making information more accessible through software. Here are some ways I've explored these interests:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Option Pricing Web Application** - Displays details about an option's price based on Black-Scholes, and stores option details in a Postgres Database</li>
<li>**AST Parser and Comparison Tool** - Parses the Clang-generated AST to a JSON format similar to static analysis tools like Joern. Employs NetworkX in Python to compare edge counts, and analyse for sentiments like liveliness and reachability</li>
<li>**CHIP-8 Emulator** - A simple implementation of the classic CHIP-8 Emulator is what helped me move from C to C++.</li>
