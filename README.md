# Hi! I'm Matthew
I'm a Computer Science and Business student at McGill University. I've done research in Program Graph Generation and Security Analysis. I'm also interested in Markets and working with Financial Data. Here are some samples of my work:
<br>

* [**Cryptocurrency Market Data Aggregator**](https://github.com/matthew-chang04/crypto-market-dashboard) - Uses a scalable WebSocket setup in C++ to connect to Cryptocurrency exchanges via websockets. Data is aggregated and kept in a single orderbook.
* [**Graph Research Tools**](https://github.com/matthew-chang04/Graph-Extraction-Tools) - Built scripts and tools to edit and analyze Code Property Graphs to optimise their interpretation by Security Analysis Models. Work was done in Scala, Python, and C++.
